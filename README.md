# DroidSeries
DroidSeries is a TV Series/TV Shows browser and tracker application for Android.
Tacking down TV series, episodes, air dates, etc, is a difficult task as there are so many TV shows. 
DroidSeries will help you manage your favorite TV shows and keep track of the episodes that you have or have not seen.

Joaquim Rocha created an app for Maemo called SeriesFinale and I can say that this concept is his idea. 
I just wanted to have it on Android so I made a similar one.

This version is still very fresh and may have lots of bugs. Help us by testing it and reporting the bugs!

DroidSeries is free and open source.

I stopped developing DroidSeries a long time ago. 

I recommend anyone interested in this project to checkout:
